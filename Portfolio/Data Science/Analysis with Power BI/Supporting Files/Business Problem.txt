Sales Manager:


Hello All!


I hope you are doing well.  I need you to improve our internet sales report and want to move it from static reports to an interactive visual dashboard.


Essentially, we want to focus on how much we have sold of what products, to which silence and how it has sold over time.


Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.


We measure our numbers against a budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.


The budget is for 2023 and we usually look 4 years back when doing analysis of sales.


Let me know if you need anything else.


Regards.
